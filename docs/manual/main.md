## :wave: Introduction

The Enhanced Realm addon is a comprehensive tool to manage game stats like Health, Mana, Speed, Attack Damage, etc., along with status effects such as buffs and debuffs. It uses the principles of reactive programming to ensure your stats are always up-to-date and easily manageable.

## :rocket: Getting Started

First, make sure you've followed the [Installation](/README.md#installation) instructions from the README file.

- Ensure that the addon is activated in your Godot project.
- Make sure the `enhanced_common` dependency is also activated.

## Resource Management
All resources whether they are `Stat`, `Stats` or `StatusEffect` are templates. It means, they will be duplicated at runtime by their `StatsManager` or `StatusEffectManager`, it ensures the uniqueness of each stat for each instance of scenes.
> For example, you don't want all of your enemies to share the same health bar !
